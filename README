[Configuration]
  --enable-oss:    By default Volume Icon will be built with ALSA as its
                   backend. Note that it is not possible to build with both ALSA
                   and OSS support at the moment, so using this flag will
                   disable ALSA support.
                 
  --enable-notify: Enables notifications, this adds a dependency for
                   libnotify >= 0.5.0.

  --with-oss-include-path: Location of soundcard.h, defaults first to the value
                   specified in /etc/oss.conf. If that does not exist
                   it defaults to /usr/lib/oss/include/sys.

  --with-default-mixerapp: Set the default mixer application, defaults to alsamixer.
